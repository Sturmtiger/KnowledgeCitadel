#zettelkasten #note-taking 

* The notes are modular, this makes it possible to move them around.
* They can be reused in other contexts to support different arguments.
* The ability to try different combinations of notes and slide them around to let the structure emerge organically is one of the most powerful features of the [[Zettelkasten method]] for improving your thinking and writing.
* The notes will reveal holes in your understanding, and these holes can be used as starting points for further research.
* Storing your thoughts externally makes it easier to work on multiple projects simultaneously.
