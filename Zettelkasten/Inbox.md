Inbox is a place where you temporarily put your newly created notes.
This will stimulate you to do more notes.
Later, you revisit the **Inbox** dir with a fresh mind and handle each note it contains.
Some of them will be improved and moved to appropriate places, some of them you'll find unnecessary and remove them.

For example, you have an interesting idea, you create a note in the **Inbox** dir.
This will start to get you into a note-taking habit.
However, it does require discipline, because you will have to process these notes and put them in proper places.

Itâ€™s an extra layer of thought on your notes because it allows you to analyze and filter them again.
