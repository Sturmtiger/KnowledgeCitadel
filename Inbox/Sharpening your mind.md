We are living in the digital age, our minds are overloaded and our nervous systems are overstimulated with the abundance of information.

We need to start limiting the information we consume in order to sharpen our minds.

>“Like a scientist capturing only the rarest butterflies to take back to the lab, our goal should be to “capture” only the ideas and insights we think are truly noteworthy.” - Tiago Forte

The key is intentionality and consciousness.

In order to increase your productivity you should clearly divide time when you are intentional and time to relax.

During intentional time you only consume content scheduled beforehand with a clear purpose.
Use your relax time to recharge, use it wisely. Doom-scrolling, consuming brain-rot content, binge-watching TV series are NOT conducive to recharging but rather exhaust you even more.
