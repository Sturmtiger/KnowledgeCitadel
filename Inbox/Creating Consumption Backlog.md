From the daily note create a note for content youâ€™re interested in.
Add a link to the content and #consume tag.

Move your newly created backlog content note into an appropriate subdir in the **Input** dir.
For example, if it's an article it goes to **Input/Articles**.

Delete #consume tag once the content note is processed.
