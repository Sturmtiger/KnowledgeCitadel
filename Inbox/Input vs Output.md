Let’s say we want to process an article dedicated to K8S.

We put an initial content note into the [[Inbox]] dir, we then consume all the article’s info, we flesh it out into consequent chains of thought.

After refinement, the content note gets transferred to the **Input/Articles** dir and its subsequent notes go to the **Zettelkasten** dir.

A possible **output** could be your product of thought that you’ve synthesized from this article (or a set of resources) into a course, book, or another article which explores a specific K8S topic from the article further.
