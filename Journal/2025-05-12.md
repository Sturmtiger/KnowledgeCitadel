Today I'm starting my Obsidian Vault, which will be named **Knowledge Citadel**.
I believe the name carries some sense of sacredness.
As you name the boat, so shall it float!

I promise myself that this decision will be a major breakthrough in my life.

So far, I've been taking notes in a traditional and thus chaotic way - tons of info spread all over the place: Google Drive, my PC, smartphone notes - which is quite restrictive and hinders my potential.

The time has come to change it!
