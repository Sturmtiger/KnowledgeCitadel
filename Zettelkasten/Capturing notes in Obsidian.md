#note-taking #obsidian 

All starts from a **daily note** (they are created in the **Journal** dir, we configured newly created daily notes to be placed there).
All **content notes** get created in the **Inbox** dir (we configured it so).

There **SHOULD NOT** be orphaned notes!

In **daily notes** you may write what you do, what you feel.
All **content notes** start from the **daily note** by creating a link and then navigating through it.
Then, from content notes chains of thought are created (new notes).

New notes in the **Inbox** dir must be revisited and processed within 1-2 days ideally.
