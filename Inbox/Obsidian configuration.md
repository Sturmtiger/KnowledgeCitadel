#obsidian 

Obsidian has the Vim mode.
Obsidian allows setting up hotkeys.

Useful plugins:
- **Quick Explorer** - for the keyboard-centered usage of Obsidian
- **GIt** - to back up your vault (there's a sync functionality as well but it doesn't work well on all platforms)
- **Templater** - to create templates for different use cases
