#note-taking #PARA 

This is where you place notes which are not useful currently or in the near future.

A [[PARA Project|project]] or an [[PARA Area|area]] may be transitioned to the archive after completion.
The archive may also be turned back to the [[PARA Project|project]] or [[PARA Area|area]]. It’s possible when you resume some activity.

What’s great about the archive is that in Obsidian when you’ll start searching for notes you may come across an old note from the archive that you had totally forgotten about. Sometimes it may appear super relevant and you make a connection that is totally unexpected.
