## Processing The Inbox on the example of notes written down while reading an article

- Flesh out the note.
- Put all the details in order.
- Check whether the grammar, spelling is correct.
- Whether it is written clearly and whether the note makes sense by itself.
- Make sure it's written in a presentable way, as if for publication.

Once the the above steps are done it's time to move the note to the **Zettelkasten** dir.

### TODO: Think on where to put it. Remember - there's [[PARA Inbox]]. The main idea is same, maybe unify it somehow

Inbox is a place where you temporarily put your newly created notes.
Later, you revisit Inbox with a fresh mind and handle each note it contains.
Some of them (chains of thought) will be improved and moved to Zettelkasten, some of them youlll find unnecessary and remove them.
Also, some notes will go into the Input dir.
For example, if you created an initial note dedicated to an article. Eventually, It would go  into the Input/Articles dir.
