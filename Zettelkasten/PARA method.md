#note-taking #PARA

**PARA** acronym stands for:
- [[PARA Project|Projects]]
- [[PARA Area|Areas]]
- [[PARA Resource|Resources]]
- [[PARA Archive|Archive]]

The PARA method was invented by Tiago Forte.

This method is suitable for beginners.

The PARA method helps to keep the distinctions between short-term [[PARA Project|projects]] and long-term [[PARA Area|areas]].
It helps to make the division between [[PARA Project|projects]] and [[PARA Area|areas]] and get a clear picture of priorities.

Without structure, a person tends to keep all their projects in their head.
They do things randomly, in the moment that feels best for them.
<u>This leads to a ton of unfinished tasks!</u>

It feels natural to separate things and putting notes in certain categories.
But as your note-taking becomes advanced then it becomes less significant.
In the [[Zettelkasten method]] there's no such structure.
