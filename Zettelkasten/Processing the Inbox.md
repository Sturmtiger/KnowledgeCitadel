Use tags to either indicate a **state** or a **type**.

Say, we've taken notes from an article.
We would then need to:
- Flesh out the notes.
- Put all the details in order.
- Check whether the grammar and spelling are correct.
- Check whether each note is written clearly and makes sense by itself.
- Make sure each note is written in a presentable way, as if for publication.

Once the above steps are applied each note gets moved to an appropriate dir.

## Example
Let's say you are processing an article.
In this case you would create an initial article note and further notes (chains of thought) from it.

After processing the initial article note would go to the **Input/Articles** dir, and the further notes would go to the [[Zettelkasten method|Zettelkasten]] dir.
