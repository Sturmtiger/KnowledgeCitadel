#note-taking

Inbox is where you capture your notes while you are on the go. This will stimulate you to do more notes since.

For example, you have an interesting idea, you create a note in the Inbox, and that's it.
This will start to get you into a note-taking habit.
However, It does require discipline because you will have to process these notes and put them into appropriate [[PARA Project|projects]] / [[PARA Area|areas]].

Itâ€™s an extra layer of thought on your notes because it allows you to analyze and filter them again.
