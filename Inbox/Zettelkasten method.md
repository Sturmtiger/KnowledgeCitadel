#note-taking #zettelkasten

The Zettelkasten method was invented by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann).
* [[Principles of the Zettelkasten method]]

Everything lives in one big directory with all of your notes in there and then all of these notes are linked among each other with a system of identifiers (markdown links in [[Obsidian]]).

You do not start with a predefined structure like in [[PARA method|the PARA method]], you let that structure come organically by linking notes.

Zettelkasten is not just a note-taking system like [[PARA method|the PARA method]], but is a thinking tool.

You can rearrange notes order, mix them with notes from different topics to come up with a completely new idea. You can use [[Canvas]] to do it in [[Obsidian]].
