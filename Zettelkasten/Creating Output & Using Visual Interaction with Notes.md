Use Internal Obsidian [[Canvas]] and the **Excalidraw** plugin to explore your notes.

You can create a canvas, attach various notes to it, move them around, link them.

This is how you can put together something completely new.

For instance, you want to write an article.
You take the canvas youâ€™ve composed and use it to write an article.
The fact your notes are polished as if they are for publication makes the article creation process so much easier.
