#note-taking #zettelkasten

Everything lives in one big directory with all of your notes in there and then all of these notes are linked among each other with a system of identifiers (markdown links in Obsidian).

Principles of the Zettelkasten method:
- Each index card (note) contains one discrete idea that makes perfect sense in and of itself.
- Interconnectedness of the cards.
- Emerging structure.
- Cards are paraphrased in your own words (no quotes and very sparingly).

You do not start with a predefined structure like in [[PARA method|the PARA method]], you let that structure come organically by linking notes.

Zettelkasten is not just a note-taking system like the PARA method, but is a thinking tool.
