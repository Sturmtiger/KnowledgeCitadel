#note-taking 

It's a common pitfall to believe we fully understand something simply because it appears easy to grasp while reading a well written book.

Many people have faced the frustration of realizing what seems straightforward, say, in the video, is much more challenging in practice. Our mind can deceive us making concepts appear easier than they truly are.

You only discover how well you’ve grasped the material when you start writing about it!

You are taking notes as you are consuming the content!
You write these [[Fleeting notes|fleeting notes]] without putting too much effort in it.

Then, when you have finished consuming the material (source, article etc.), you will process the notes you've taken. (*this flow has something in common with a book [[Как читать книги - С.И. Поварнин]]*)
You take the notes you wrote down, flesh them out into [[Permanent notes|permanent notes]] in your own words.
This is where real thinking starts to happen, and it's an uncomfortable experience because you are challenging your own thinking.

He writes notes about stuff he learns, and then explains the topics in his own words, thus verifying his understanding and the clarity of his own thinking.
