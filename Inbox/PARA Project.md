#note-taking #PARA 

A project is simply a folder that you collect notes in.

For example, for **Vacation hiking** project you would have several tasks to research:
- Destinations
- Book a flight
- Packing list
- Gear

A project can transition to a [[PARA Area|area]] or an [[PARA Archive|archive]].
In case of the **Vacation hiking** project it will transition to [[PARA Archive|archive]].
But a project may also transition to [[PARA Area|area]].
For example, you started a project of buying a house and then, when it's completed, the project transitions to [[PARA Area|area]], because you will have ongoing processes related to the house, like gardening and the like.
