#note-taking #PARA

**PARA** acronym stands for:
- [[PARA Project|Projects]]
- [[PARA Area|Areas]]
- [[PARA Resource|Resources]]
- [[PARA Archive|Archive]]

The PARA method was invented by Tiago Forte.

This method is suitable for beginners.

The PARA method helps to keep the distinctions between short-term **projects** and long-term **areas**.
It helps to make the division between **projects** and **areas** and get a clear picture of priorities.

With having no structure a person tends to have all their projects in their head. They do stuff randomly in the moment that they feel suited best for it. <u>This leads to a ton of unfinished tasks!</u>

It feels natural to separate things and putting notes in certain categories.
But as your note-taking becomes advanced then it becomes less significant.
In the [[Zettelkasten method]] there's no such structure.
