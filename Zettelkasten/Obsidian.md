Obsidian has great search functionality. It's possible to search for:
- Path
- File
- Tag
- Line
- Section

Obsidian allows:
- Creating links between notes
- Visualizing notes and how they relate to each other
- Having tags on notes
- Portability (your vaults can be synchronized across different devices: PC, laptop, smartphone etc.)

All your data is stored locally in markdown files which is good for safety and brings flexibility.

Command-line focused engineers may take advantage of this by:
- Running scripts on the files
- Use preferred text editors (e.g. Vim)
